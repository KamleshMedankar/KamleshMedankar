👋 Hi, I’m Kamlesh Medankar
👀 I’m interested in building scalable, high-performance applications, distributed systems, and exploring new technologies like Go, Kafka, Redis, and microservices.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud architectures, Kubernetes, and advanced Go programming patterns.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, backend services, and systems design challenges.
📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me on LinkedIn or email me at kamlesh.medankar@example.com.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I once solved a complex bug in a production system using Redis and Kafka that saved the team hours of downtime. Also, I love playing chess in my free time!
